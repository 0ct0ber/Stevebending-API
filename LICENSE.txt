                                           Stevebending API License v1.0

    This license is subject to change in newer versions of the API. Please check back then as well.

    Definitions:
    "the repository" - The Stevebending API GitHub repository, found here: https://github.com/0ct0ber/Stevebending-API
    "shading" - Using software (ex: Maven-Shade-Plugin) to fill in code dependencies by copying and repackaging the
                dependency into the exported jar
    "the API" - The Stevebending API
    "gameplay features" - Features that affect the gameplay for players, not just in a cosmetic or informational way


You are hereby permitted to use the Stevebending API under the following terms and conditions below.

1. Copying, redistributing, modification, regular use

You may not copy or redistribute the API, except for purely the contributions you have made to the repository* or where 
denoted as free to copy and redistribute. Redistributing includes "shading" (see definitions) jars of the API into plugins and 
likewise.

You may only modify the contents of artifacts of the API and/or repackage it for the purposes of testing or contributing to 
the repository. This includes changing any files in the jar.

Classes are allowed to extend and override the API where normally possible without reflection. You may not use reflection or
other means to change how the code in the API functions.

*Under terms in section 4. Contributor's agreement


2. Monetization

Software (plugins, abilities, code, etc.) written that uses the API (even indirectly) may not be sold or paid for development-
you can’t receive payment for developing the software, and you can’t pay someone else for developing it. You also are not
allowed to charge payment for servers’ use of features in the software.

You may however receive donations for your work on the software after publicly releasing it for download, if the donations are
optional and grant nothing in return to the specific donors.


3. Design & Gameplay

Plugins made with the API must not restrict players from using enabled gameplay features. Any features intended to be used by
regular players (guest, member, VIP/donor, etc) and not for testing or administration purposes must be equally available to
all players- either all players are able to use it, or no players are able to use it. The only exceptions are restricting 
abilities to specific elements defined in the API, or if an ability has written approval from me to be an unlockable or 
special ability. This section may change in future versions of the API to be less restrictive.


4. Contributor's agreement/Terms of Contribution

You may only commit your own code, or code licensed that we are allowed to use (license must be included/linked on the file).

By committing your code to the repository, you automatically agree to the following:

a. The code will be licensed here under the API's license, and we are not required to remove it or follow additional terms 
set by you after it is already committed.
b. This license may change in the future and for newer releases of the API, so long as the API remains free to download and 
with publicly viewable source code.
c. It is your duty to make it clear who else is allowed to use your contributed code. If you plan on letting others use it or 
use a plugin/software with it, you must make that information clear through your GitHub account.
d. Wherever you plan on reusing it elsewhere, you must change the package name to no longer include the Stevebending or 
Stevebending API package (so that people don't accidentally use reflection to change the API).
e. The code can be used in the official Stevebending plugin (which is not the API)

These terms only apply to significant code changes, and not minor fixes or typo corrections.

End of license. If you have any suggestions, let me know!
